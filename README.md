# JavaDataStructures
Arrays
arrays have built in mehtods like to string to print the string of the array
Fixed in size
Compact Memory usage if size is known
Delete operation very hard
First index starts at 0

2d Arrays
2d Arrays are like a bunch of cells
Similar to excel u read using grid points starting at 0
2d Arras are initialized with 2 [][] ->  char[][]
since the array is 2d we have to use .deeptostring to return a string value of the array 

Lists and Array Lists
an array list is an ordered collection or sequence
Allows duplicates
Not fied in size like Arrays
Fast for data retrieval 
Various implementations
  -ArrayList
  -Stack
  -Vector
  -Others
if you dont use <> then it wont specify the data type

Stacks
LIFO LAST IN FIRST OUT
It extends class vector
Usual push and pop operations are provided 
to find out whats at the top of the stack use peek
there are methods to check if the stack is empty, or see how far an item is from the top

Sets
sets contain no duplicates
we dont know whats inside the set, no order is guaranteed
sets contain no pair of elements that equal each other
one null

Queues
FIFO First in first out
A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing 
Like a printer, the elements or pages are queued and printed based on which was sent first, not most recent

Linked Lists
made up of multiple nodes that contains a reference to the previous and reference node. Where the previous reference node for node 1 is null
and the reference to the next node for the last node is also null
Linked lists are bi directional
Can be any datatype
In order to add a new node it must point to its reference nodes.

Map Interface
can be used for most coding challenges
Map has Hashtable, Hashmap, and Sortedmap implementations
A map is a collection of key value pairs
a map cannot contain duplicate keys
Each key can map to at most one value

Hashfunctions
Mapping an obect to its integer value
Hash code will always be the same for the same object
